- Meta: whenever you fulfill a new user-visible requirement, append a concise bullet about it here.
- The program bumps a global build counter on every build so the version reads 0.000N.
- The window title shows "coilviewer" followed by that current build version.
- The viewer accepts an optional command-line argument, resolves it against the file system (including environment variables), and loads that folder or image on startup.
- The program supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP/DIB, TIFF, and WebP files via Windows Imaging Component.
- The program lists every image in the chosen folder and moves between them instantly.
- The overlay presents the active sort mode and the key metadata for the displayed image.
- The program sorts images by filename, creation time, modification time, or size in ascending or descending order.
- Right-click opens a sort menu that updates the config and reflects the current sort choice.
- The program lets Space, Backspace, and the arrow keys move to the next or previous image.
- Home jumps to the first image and End jumps to the last image in the sequence.
- F11 and a double-click toggle fullscreen mode on and off.
- Ctrl+O opens an image and loads its folder; drag and drop does the same.
- Ctrl+R reloads the JSON config without restarting; menu changes save back to the same file.
- The config file controls preload radius, cache size, background color, fit/scaling mode, overlay visibility, loop behavior, and default sort.
- The program preloads neighboring images so navigation remains instant.
- The "I" key toggles the metadata overlay with a gentle fade.
- "/" or "?" toggles a keyboard shortcut list that can be dismissed quickly.
- "=" (or Shift+=) zooms in, "-" zooms out, and zoom resets when a new image loads.
- "\" resets zoom to the fitted scale without disturbing navigation.
- When zoomed, the arrow keys and mouse wheel pan the image smoothly.
- When not zoomed, the mouse wheel navigates to the previous or next image.
- The shortcuts overlay highlights the "A" key for automatically archiving the current image into the "old" folder.
- Mouse drag pans the zoomed image while leaving image navigation unchanged.
- Pressing "A" moves the current image into an "old" subfolder, auto-renaming to avoid collisions, and keeps browsing smooth.
- Launch and error details are written to `coilviewer-launch.log` and `coilviewer-errors.log` near the project root.
- Never use fancy quotes; use ASCII quotes only.
- Never use emojis in any output.

- Ctrl+Shift+Arrow keys jump halfway toward the start or end of the image list for rapid exploration.
